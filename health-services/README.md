Health Services Samples
======================

This repository contains a set of individual Android Studio projects to help you
get started writing Health Services apps on Wear OS.

Read below for a description of each sample.

> Note: The Health Services API is in alpha release, meaning that [APIs may be added, removed, or changed](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/versions). We do not recommend developing a production app against the API at the current time, or making plans that depend on the API becoming stable or widely available at a specific time.

> Note: Many of these sample apps make use of fragments which have [some drawbacks](https://developer.android.com/training/wearables/views/navigation#implement-nav). For new apps, we now recommend using [Wear Compose](https://developer.android.com/training/wearables/compose) for your UI.
